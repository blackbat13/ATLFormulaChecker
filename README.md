# ATL Model-checker

#### Collection of algorithms for verification of ATLir models

## Currently implemented models
+ Bridge scenario
+ Castles
+ Dining Cryptographers
+ Machines and Robots in the factory
+ Tian Ji
+ Drones and pollution

## Requirements
+ Python 3.7 minimum
+ All libraries from requirements.txt
+ PyCharm IDE (Community or Professional)

## Getting started

First you need to open the project directory in the PyCharm IDE.
For some reason, without it, Python cannot see the modules.
I will try to fix that.

### Approximations

To run experiments using approximations algorithm, simply select the desired model in the simple_model/experiments folder and run it in the PyCharm IDE.
Please keep in mind that you may need to modify the code a little, as not all of the experiments are implemented in an user-friendly way.

### DominoDFS

To run experiments using DominoDFS algorithm, open desired model in the comparing_strats/experiments folder and run in in the PyCharm IDE.
